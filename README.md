# timedQuiz

## Description

This is the UW Boot Camp Week 4 Challenge. Student was asked to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

## Usage

When the page is loaded, a high score board link is located on the top left corner and a timer is on the top right corner. 

When the "start quiz" button is clicked, user is prompted with the first question, and the timer starts.

When the user picked an answer, the next question will be prompted. A message will let the user know if their answer to the last question is correct or wrong. If the answer is wrong, 15 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

The quiz will end if the timer reaches zero, or if all questions are answered.

When the quiz is over, the user will be prompted to enter their initials to save their scores.

From the high scores page, the user can choose to return to the game or clear all scores.
